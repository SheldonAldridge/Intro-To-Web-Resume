                <p>
                    I have a passion for technology and design. I am eager to learn, which results in upskilling myself
                    and obtaining a new skillset, which could be used to benefit the company I am/could be working for.
                    I have a great attitude, which I believe is 80% of the game, I am self-motivated, which resulted in
                    putting myself through short online courses, I am a team player, which means I am easy to get along
                    with and works with the organization and team members to achieve the company's goals and vision, I
                    welcome constructive criticism, as this pushes me to become the best version of myself, I am a quick
                    learner, as I have taught myself coding where I could build a basic website, if needed and I am
                    inquisitive, which leads me to find a solution to a problem effectively.
